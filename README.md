## Documentation

Read the **[official documentation](https://justinmahar.github.io/silly-password-generator/)**.

### [→ Generate Silly Passwords ←](https://justinmahar.github.io/silly-password-generator/?path=/story/tools--silly-password-generator)

## Overview

Generate fun and silly passwords that are secure, easy to type, and easy to remember. Inspired by [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/936/).

Would you rather use the password [`Tr0ub4dor&3`](https://xkcd.com/936/) or `exciting creepy macho tiger`? 

Using an unrestricted brute-force attack, the first would take 3 seconds to crack, and the second would take 1 month. Exciting creepy macho tigers for the win!

### Features include:

- **💩 Fun passwords are better than boring ones**
  - Why use lame and hard to remember passwords, when you can use fun ones... that are also secure?
- **👨‍🔬 Password analysis**
  - Leverage the brainpower of at least a dozen nerds. This library makes sure your password is secure using [zxcvbn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zxcvbn).
- **🔐 Secure**
  - Have I mentioned that they're secure? Well, they are!
- **🔢 Customizable**
  - Choose from a set of options to customize your password.

## Installation

```
npm i silly-password-generator
```

## Quick Start

### Via Website

Go here: [Silly Password Generator](https://justinmahar.github.io/silly-password-generator/?path=/story/tools--silly-password-generator)

### Via npm

```js
import { generateSillyPassword } from 'silly-password-generator';
```

```js
// Use with no options to generate a 4-word silly password
generateSillyPassword(); // `thorough loud annoying penguin`

// Provide a custom word count if you'd like
generateSillyPassword({ wordCount: 7 }); // `glamorous large powerful fast black noisy clam`

// Capitalize the first letter of the resulting password
generateSillyPassword({ capitalize: true }); // `Curious fluffy excited copperhead`

// You can provide salt to strengthen your passwords, too. Salt is appended to the end.
generateSillyPassword({ salt: "!?!?" }); // `damned important envious pangolin!?!?`
```

> Combine options as you see fit. The `wordCount` must be at least `1`.

### Analyzing Password Strength

This library uses [zxcvbn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zxcvbn) to analyze password strength. This was written by a bunch of nerds, so you know it's legit.

```js
import { analyzePassword } from 'silly-password-generator';
```

```js
// Returns an object telling you how awesome or crappy your password is.
const results = analyzePassword(sillyPassword); 
```

See the [zxcvbn Usage section](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zxcvbn#usage) for the properties available.
